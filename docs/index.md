# Welcome Libre TrainSim

This project is created by Jean28518 from germany in his free time, who is studying computer science. The aim is to create a modern fully free Train Simulator for Linux, Mac and Windows.

## News:

### October 2020

Hello all! I hope you had a great summer! So the weather will get colder, and rainy, so I continued the development of Libre TrainSim. We have some news:

At first we have now an official website. It doesn't look nice, but is functional enough. So everything now comes together to one site where you can find everything. The domain is: [libre-trainsim.de](https://www.libre-trainsim.de)

Since the last post already many joined our Discord-Channel. This is the easiest way to get in contact with other community members. So if you didn't join already, its highly recommended! -> [Join](https://discord.gg/AQdAtZZ)

So let's come to Libre TrainSim specific things:

In the last days I finished a complete new track: U2-Nuremberg. It is the first metro track, and has 8 stations. It will come with version 0.7.

Also today I finished the Documentation for making tracks in Libre TrainSim - Because that will be one of a great new feature in 0.7! You can't actually create one, but have a look to it: [Click me](https://github.com/Jean28518/Libre-TrainSim/wiki/Building-Tracks-for-Libre-TrainSim---Official-Documentation)

Also I improved many editor features, and made it more stable. Some small bugfixes where also made.

So when comes the next version?

Currently I can't give you a specific date, but there aren't so much things anymore implementing to 0.7:
- Improving HUD: Adding more Information
- Adding Key-Map Settings
- Adding Main-Menu Music
- Fixing some small editor-bugs
You can follow the actual progress [here](https://github.com/Jean28518/Libre-TrainSim/projects/3)

In the end I wan't to thank some youtubers, who did a video about libre trainsim. It makes me proud, that so many people like this project, and are following it. Also thank you for 30 stars!

Best whishes

### May 2020

Greetings to all!

It's over a month ago you got a last update of the development progress.
Lets get an update!

The progress for the new version 0.7 is almost done, there are just some small things which need to be done technically. At the moment I am writing a documentation for the Editor. About 60% of the documentation is done. Almost all articles where written, but some of them need some polishing.
New Discord Channel:
- There now exists a Discord Channel for the Libre TrainSim community. It would be great to welcome you there!

#### Let us see what has been done so far since the version 0.6:
- Rails with slope and tendency: Rails can now change their height, and can tend itself.

- Outer View of Trains: You can now see the train from the outside. Animation of doors and of the pantograph where added too:

- Autopilot: From now on you don't have to drive the train yourself. You could press Ctrl + A, sit back, and watch the train driving itself.
- NPC Trains: You are not anymore alone! 
- Intelligent Signals: Signals can now be activated by driving over, and recognize under the hood the signal after them. That makes it a lot easier for track creators.
- Shadows, better materials, and lights:  From now on the materials of the objects look a bit more realistic. Also lights of the train and shadows of the sun where added:

- New Metro Track (WIP): Parallel to the writing at the documentation I create a new track: An metro track with 7 stations. Here's a teaser:

Also some smaller things where fixed and got improved. But for now that was enough.

Thank you for reading, and hopefully we will see us all in the next version!
