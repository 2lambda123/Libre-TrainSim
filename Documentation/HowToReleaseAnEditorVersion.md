# How to release an editor version:

- Clone the repository, and check, if you are using the newest GoDot Version.
- Open up the project with GoDot. ReImporting Assets is normally here, and can take some time.
- Delete other folders in /Resources except for /Resources/Basics
- Duplicate World Pattern, make a new directory /Worlds/RenameMe, move the duplicated to this folder, and rename it to : 'RenameMe.tscn'
- Check in the main menu the version numer ;)
- Rename the Project in the Project Settings to: "Libre TrainSim Editor"
- Now you can close GoDot. Rename the src folder to "LibreTrainSimEditor", and zip this folder.
